# student-diary

This program consists of all the information of multiple students, including personal details, courses registered, marks in each course, attendance in each, events participated and their details, etc.
The information is initially read from text files  

The Driver has to be run first,  

You either choose if you are  
1. a student or  
2. a faculty

Access:  
1. Student can only view his/her details in various fields 
2. Faculty has option to both edit or see the information of different fields

Finally all the edited objects are written to files

This project, that I did in S3 is an implementation of various OOP concepts of java like:
*java classes and objects
*inheritence and polymorphism
*interfaces and packages
*java i/o and exception handling
*java api and collection framework
*threads
*applets
